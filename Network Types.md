# Network Types

- Every network is either a *peer-to-peer network* or a *client/server network*
  - Any network that does not have dedicated servers and network endpoints act as both clients and servers is a *peer-to-peer network*
  - Any network with dedicated servers is a *client/server network*

### LANs

- Network that is restricted to a single location, usually covers a small area (think office building, house, etc.)
- Used to share file and resources
- Higher speed and cheaper than a WAN
  
### WLANs

- Send and receive data using radio frequency signals
- Common setup uses a wireless transmitter/receiver or Access Points (APs)

### WANs

- Network that spans more than one geographic location, usually connecting multiple LANs
- Slower than LANs
- Needs expensive hardware (think routers and leased lines)
- More complex implementation procedures

### MANs

- *Metropolitan-area Network*
- A WAN that is limited to a certain geographic area (think college campus or city)
- Smaller than a WAN but bigger than a LAN

### CANs

- *Campus-area Network (CAN)*
- Links buildings and contains multiple LANs
- Think industrial complexes, military bases, office buildings, etc.

### SANs

- *Storage-area network (SAN)*
- Made up of network/shared storage devices
- Offers data storage and shows up as locally attached devices (think network shares, file shares, etc.)

### PANs

- *Personal-area network (PAN)*
- A LAN created to share data between devices associated with you
- Think connecting laptops, smartphones, smart watches, etc.

### SDWANs

- *Software-defined wide area network (SDWAN)*
- Think bring the ease of the cloud to your network configurations
- Enables services on-demand, reduces costs, improve network scalability and performance
- Uses a centralized controller for setting and maintaining policies

### MPLS

- *Multiprotocol Label Switching*
- WAN technology used in telecommunication networks
- Uses short path labels instead of long network addresses to send data from one node to another
- Supports technologies like ATM, Frame Relay, DSL, T1 and E1

### mGRE

- *Multipoint Generic Routing Encapsulation*
- Extension of GRE
- Dynamically establishes tunnels without needing to configure mapping entries between each and every possible next-hop destination
