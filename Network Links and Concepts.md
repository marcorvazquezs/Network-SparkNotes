# Network Links and Concepts

### DSL

- Internet access method that uses a phone line to provide high-speed access
- Inexpensive
- **DSL Flavors**
  - **Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)**
    - High data rate in only one direction (fast downloads / slow uploads)
  - **Symmetric DSL (SDSL)**
    - Offers same speeds for uploads and downloads
  - **High-rate Digital Subscriber Line (HDSL)**
    - Provides a bidirectional high-data-rate service that need high data rates (think videoconferencing)
  - **ISDN DSL**
    - Symmetric type of DSL often used when SDSL and ADSL are not available
  - **Rate-adaptive DSL (RADSL)**
    - Variation on ADSL that can change transmission speeds based on signal quality.
  - **Very high-bit-rate DSL (VHDSL)**
    - Asymmetric version of DSL
    - Can get up to 10 Mbps, fastest form of DSL
    - Uses fiber-optic cabling
  - **High-bit-rate DSL (HDSL)**
    - A symmetric technology that gives identical transmission rates in both directions.
    
    | DSL Variation | Upload Speed | Download Speed |
    | ------------- | -------------| -------------- |
    | ADSL | 1 Mbps | 3 Mbps | 
    | ADSL2 | 1.3 Mbps | 12 Mbps | 
    | ADSL2+ | 1.4 Mbps | 24 Mbps |
    | SDSL | 1.5 Mbps | 1.5 Mbps |
    | IDSL | 144 Kbps | 144 Kbps |
    | RADSL | 1 Mbps | 7 Mbps | 
    | VHDSL | 1.6 Mbps | 13 Mbps |
    |HDSL | 768 Kbps | 768 Kbps |

### Cable Broadband
- Uses a cable modem
- One big con is that you share the available bandwidth with everyone else in your cable area

### Leased Lines
- High speed digital lines that can be leased from telephone companies
- Give you an always-open, always available connection between you and who you choose to connect to
